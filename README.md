# CCNA Networking Projects Portfolio

This repository contains two networking **projects** built as part of CCNA studies:

1. **Project 1 – CML BGP Routing Project** (`project-bgp-cml/`)  
   A Cisco Modeling Labs (CML) topology focusing on BGP routing between multiple routers.

2. **Project 2 – Secure Site-to-Site Network (Packet Tracer)** (`project-secure-site2site/`)  
   A two-site network (Montreal & Toronto) with routing, services, security (ZBF, 802.1X, AAA), NAT, and an IPsec site-to-site VPN, implemented in Cisco Packet Tracer.

## Project 1 – CML BGP Routing Project

Folder: `project-bgp-cml/`

- `BGP.yaml` – CML topology file.
- `configs/routers-switches.md` – Device configurations extracted from the CML file.
- `topology/topology.md` – Link list and topology description.

Open this project in **Cisco Modeling Labs** to explore BGP behavior between routers and how routes are exchanged across networks.

## Project 2 – Secure Site-to-Site Network (Packet Tracer)

Folder: `project-secure-site2site/`

- `packet-tracer/PART 1.pkt` … `PART 4.pkt` – Stepwise Packet Tracer projects that build up the full secure design.
- `configs/` – Addressing plans and configuration snippets for routers, switches, and services.
- `docs/CCNA.docx` – Extra written documentation.

This project demonstrates:

- IPv4 addressing, DHCP, DNS, NTP, and Syslog.
- OSPF internal routing.
- NAT for Internet access.
- SSH, port security, 802.1X, and AAA.
- Zone-Based Firewall policies.
- IPsec site-to-site VPN between the MTL and TOR sites.

You can open the `.pkt` files directly in **Cisco Packet Tracer** and follow along with the provided configs.
