# About

This portfolio is focused on **CCNA-level networking skills** and is built around practical, simulation-based projects using:

- **Cisco Modeling Labs (CML)** for virtual router topologies  
- **Cisco Packet Tracer** for end-to-end campus and WAN designs  

## Goals

- Demonstrate understanding of **routing protocols** such as BGP and OSPF  
- Show hands-on experience with **network services** (DHCP, DNS, NTP, Syslog)  
- Highlight **security features** like SSH, port security, 802.1X/AAA, Zone-Based Firewall, and IPsec VPN  
- Present work in a **clear, well-documented, and professional** format  

## How to read this portfolio
