# Project 1 – CML BGP Routing Project

This project contains a Cisco Modeling Labs (CML) topology focused on **Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)** routing between multiple routers.

## Files

- `BGP.yaml` – CML topology export for the BGP project.
- `configs/routers-switches.md` – Router configurations auto-extracted from the CML file.
- `topology/topology.md` – Description of the CML topology and link list.

## What this project demonstrates

- BGP neighbor relationships between routers.
- Route advertisement and learning between different networks.
- Basic IP routing and verification using Cisco IOS commands.

To use it:

1. Open **Cisco Modeling Labs (CML)**.
2. Import `BGP.yaml`.
3. Start the simulation and open the console for each router.
4. Compare the running configuration with `configs/routers-switches.md` if needed.
