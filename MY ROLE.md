# Professional Role & Responsibilities Demonstrated Through These Projects

These networking projects simulate the responsibilities of an entry-level to intermediate Network Engineer / Network Technician / IT Infrastructure Specialist in a real-world environment.

## Network Design & Topology Building
I have demonstrated the ability to build structured network topologies, design logical and physical layouts, and document networks—key skills in enterprise environments.

## Router & Switch Configuration
Tasks performed match those of configuring production routers and switches: IP addressing, VLANs, routing protocols, services, and troubleshooting.

## Implementing Dynamic Routing Protocols (OSPF, BGP)
Experience with OSPF and BGP reflects responsibilities in ISP networks, enterprise WAN teams, and cloud connectivity roles.

## Network Security & Hardening
I have implemented SSH, password encryption, port security, AAA/8021X, RADIUS, Zone-Based Firewall (ZBF), NAT policies, and logging—aligning with security operations tasks.

## Site-to-Site IPsec VPN Deployment
Configured IPsec VPN with ISAKMP, transform sets, ACLs, and crypto maps. Relevant to roles involving secure WAN deployments and remote branch connectivity.

## NAT & Internet Edge Configuration
Configured NAT overload, edge routing, and traffic control—important in enterprise edge networking and distributed office environments.

## Monitoring, Logging & Troubleshooting
Implemented Syslog, NTP, verification commands, and connectivity testing—mirroring daily responsibilities in NOC and IT operations teams.

## Summary of Professional Capabilities
These projects demonstrate readiness for roles such as:
- Network Engineer (Junior)
- Network Technician
- IT Infrastructure Engineer
- Security Technician (Entry-level)
- NOC Technician (Tier 1 / Tier 2)
